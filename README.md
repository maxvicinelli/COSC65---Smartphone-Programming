# COSC65---Smartphone-Programming

This repository contains the two Android apps I created in COSC65: Smartphone Programming. MyRuns is an app that uses Google Maps to track a user's location, and convert their movements into data such as speed, distance, and more. It implements an SQL database to store the user information. Other Android features implemented in the MyRuns include capturing/saving images and other information to a profile, Fragments and Tabs, and storing User Preferences. MyRuns was created in four separate installments over an eight week period; I coded it by myself. 

EventShare was an application created by myself and William Frohlich for our final project. The app lets the user broadcast public or private events, either to all other users of the app, or a select group of "friends" added by the user. Will and I both contributed to the UI and the apps backend features. Specifically, I worked on the groups functionality, both UI and backend, and the event creation activity.
